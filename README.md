# travel-app

The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive mobile travel management application that enables users to seamlessly book flights and hotels, plan and track their travel budgets, and leverage generative AI for personalized itinerary creation.

This app will streamline the travel planning process by offering an all-in-one platform where users can make travel arrangements, set financial goals, and receive AI-powered recommendations for optimizing their trip experience, ultimately enhancing convenience and financial oversight for travelers.
